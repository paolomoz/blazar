You have access to the full conversation history. Review everything that happened since the last journal entry was written (or since the conversation started if there are none yet).

Write a new journal entry for the experience journal that tracks building an LLM-driven content and experience management system.

Steps:
1. Read `journal/README.md` to find the last entry number and date
2. Review the full conversation above to reconstruct:
   - What the user wanted to do (their intent, in their own words where possible)
   - The exact prompts they gave (quote them verbatim)
   - What Claude Code did in response (tools used, files changed, commands run)
   - What worked and what didn't (any friction, retries, surprises)
   - The outcome — what was produced, did it meet the goal
3. Look for the user's casual remarks, reactions, and opinions scattered through the conversation — these are gold for the journal. Capture their authentic voice.
4. Write reflections connecting what happened to the project's thesis: can an LLM replace traditional CMS and experience management platforms?
5. Create the next numbered entry file in `journal/` (e.g., `002-short-title.md`) following the format of existing entries
6. Update the table in `journal/README.md` with the new entry

If the user added casual notes after `/journal`, weave them into the reflections:
