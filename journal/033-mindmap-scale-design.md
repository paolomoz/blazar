# 033 — Mind Map Scale Design

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Prompt:** "the reports mind map is becoming more and more crowded. need to find a design solution to make it better usable when hundreds of reports are generated by multiple users. suggest options"

## What Happened

User flagged the first real scalability concern: 14 reports in and the mind map is already getting crowded. Forward-looking — anticipating hundreds of reports from multiple users, not just one analyst on one site.

Claude explored the full mind map implementation (radial layout, proportional angle allocation, pan/zoom, SVG edges, 18 total nodes) and proposed four design options:

1. **Semantic Zoom (map metaphor)** — zoom level determines detail (clusters → cards → full detail), Google Maps style
2. **Collapsible Clusters** — expand/collapse categories, accordion behavior, auto sub-grouping at 10+ reports
3. **Filter + Fade** — search box, category toggles, user/author filter, date range slider, "related to this" mode
4. **Galaxy View** — astronomy-themed (on-brand with "Blazar"), stars = reports, constellations = categories, nebulae = experiences, Canvas/WebGL for performance

Recommended B+C (collapsible clusters + filter bar) as the pragmatic starting point, evolving toward semantic zoom at ~100 reports, with galaxy view as the long-term product vision.

## No Code Changed

Pure design consultation — no files modified. User hasn't yet chosen a direction.

## Reflection

This is the first moment where Blazar's architecture faces a real product design question, not just "add another report." The mind map was built for a demo scale (dozen reports, one analyst, one site). Multi-user, multi-experience, hundreds of reports is a fundamentally different information architecture problem.

The interesting tension: the current radial layout is *beautiful* at small scale and completely impractical at large scale. The galaxy metaphor would be the most distinctive and on-brand solution (Blazar is literally a type of active galactic nucleus), but it's also the most expensive to build. The pragmatic answer (collapsible clusters + filters) solves the problem without rewriting the renderer.

This is also the first time the *multi-user* dimension surfaced explicitly. Up to now, Blazar has been one LLM analyst auditing one site. "Multiple users" implies authentication, ownership, permissions, shared vs. private reports — an entire product layer that doesn't exist yet.

**Thesis check:** A traditional CMS would handle this with paginated lists and folder hierarchies. The mind map is trying to preserve *spatial relationships* between reports — something a flat list can't do. If the LLM is going to generate hundreds of interconnected analyses, the navigation surface has to be smarter than a file browser. This is where Blazar either becomes a product or stays a demo.
