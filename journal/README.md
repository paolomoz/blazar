# Blazar Journal

## Thesis

Can an LLM-driven system replace traditional CMS platforms and experience management tools — not just for content creation, but for the entire lifecycle of analysis, optimization, and governance?

| # | Date | Title | Summary |
|---|------|-------|---------|
| 001 | 2026-02-24 | Project Bootstrap | Initial project setup — CLAUDE.md, journal, reports system, operational scaffolding adapted from wknd-trendsetters-playground experiment. |
| 002 | 2026-02-24 | Content Gaps: www.aem.live | First real analysis — 197 pages cross-referenced against sitemap and navigation. 37% stale content, 33% missing OG images, 17 old branding references. Visual HTML report produced. |
| 003 | 2026-02-24 | Report Hub with Mind Map | Built reports/hub.html — central navigation with interactive mind map (default) and chronological timeline views. Data-driven from manifest. |
| 004 | 2026-02-24 | Report Navigation Links | Added sticky nav bar to all reports — hub link + related report pills. Convention added to CLAUDE.md. |
| 005 | 2026-02-24 | Telemetry Value Assessment | Researched AEM operational telemetry (RUM) to evaluate what it adds beyond static content gap analysis. Key finding: enables traffic-weighted prioritization, demand-side gap discovery (404s, search queries), and performance-as-content-gap insights. |
| 006 | 2026-02-24 | Brand Guidelines Extraction | Fetched and analyzed 4 pages for brand identity. 8 core messages extracted, tone mapped across 5 dimensions, 4 positioning pillars identified, terminology catalogued, 6 inconsistencies found. First brand-category report. |
| 007 | 2026-02-24 | Brand Voice Deep Dive | Deep voice extraction from 5 new pages (FAQ, performance, architecture, RUM, go-live). 6 personality traits, 42 evidence quotes, voice spectrum on 7 axes, 23 brand terms mapped, 5 CTA patterns, 5 content type strategies documented. |
| 008 | 2026-02-24 | Image Strategy Analysis | Visual content audit across 197 pages. A+ delivery infrastructure (Media Bus, WebP, responsive picture elements) but ~95% images missing alt text (WCAG failure), 55% using generic OG fallback, no OG meta tags in HTML. 10 prioritized recommendations in visual report. |
| 009 | 2026-02-24 | Brand Reports Consolidated | Consolidated 3 intermediate reports into 2 final: Brand Guidelines Extraction (tone, structure, docs logic, images) and Improvement Opportunities (22 items, 4-sprint plan). Deleted brand-voice and image-analysis intermediates. |
| 010 | 2026-02-24 | RUM Bundler API Research | Reverse-engineered full RUM bundler API from source code. Base URL: bundles.aem.page. Three granularities (hourly/daily/monthly), domainkey auth via query param, response schema documented. Ready to fetch real traffic data. |
| 011 | 2026-02-24 | Internal Link Equity Analysis | Fetched 25+ pages to map internal link structure. 14 global nav links, FAQ is accidental equity hub (~60 content links vs docs hub's 28), /developer/tutorial is over-linked but under-linking, ~100 orphan pages, 3 legacy hlx.live links, 2 complete and 2 broken pagination chains. Visual report with hierarchy tree and chain diagrams. |
| 012 | 2026-02-24 | Competitor Brand Positioning | 6-brand competitive analysis: aem.live vs Contentful, Sanity, Netlify, Vercel, WordPress VIP. 10 dimensions scored, 7-axis tone comparison, SVG positioning map, pricing/CTA/social proof audit. Key: aem.live leads on performance + educational tone, trails on AI messaging + free tier. |
| 013 | 2026-02-24 | Image Quality & AI Improvements | End-to-end image pipeline: HEAD-inventoried 132 custom images (130/132 OK), selected 5 diverse candidates, analyzed via Gemini 2.5 Flash (avg brand score 4.4/10), generated improved versions via Gemini 3 Pro. Side-by-side comparison report with 10 recommendations. |
| 014 | 2026-02-24 | Content Readability Scoring | 10-page readability analysis testing "inclusive directness" brand claim. FK Grade 7.8 (homepage) to 13.8 (markup). 86% active voice site-wide. Author docs avg 9.1, developer docs avg 11.6. Jargon density (not sentence structure) is primary barrier. 3 pages inaccessible to non-technical stakeholders. Visual report with expandable scorecards per page. |
| 015 | 2026-02-24 | Brand Consistency Scorecard | Page-level brand voice audit across 12 pages. Mean score 76/100. 4 strong alignment (keeping-it-100: 92, tutorial: 90), 5 minor drift, 3 significant deviation (FAQ: 58, business/demo: 48). Developer pages avg 82.5 vs docs 72.7. FAQ is highest-risk due to traffic + low alignment. |
| 016 | 2026-02-24 | Developer Touchpoint Brand Audit | 5 developer touchpoints audited across 4 GitHub repos + npm + AGENTS.md. 14 legacy "helix" references in active use, only 33% naming exclusively AEM. AGENTS.md is the strongest brand document in the ecosystem. window.hlx namespace is the most impactful naming issue. Overall grade: B+ (strong code, weak metadata). |
| 017 | 2026-02-24 | SEO Brand Signals | 8-page SEO metadata audit via raw curl. Core tags present (title/desc/OG/Twitter/canonical/H1) but brand layer absent: 0/8 lang attribute, 0/8 og:type, 7/8 no structured data, 7/8 titles lack brand name. FAQ description leads with deprecated "Franklin and Helix". Site does not rank top-10 for "aem edge delivery services" -- agencies outrank official docs. |
| 018 | 2026-02-24 | Performance Brand Validation | Deep audit of "Lighthouse 100" brand promise. Critical path ~29KB compressed (vs 100KB limit), CrUX shows LCP 0.8s / INP 50ms / CLS 0.00. E-L-D architecture verified in source code. Promise substantiated -- but 100% empty alt text (83 images) is the real gap. |
| 019 | 2026-02-24 | Chat Widget | Persistent chat assistant on all reports. Cloudflare Pages Function streaming Cerebras llama3.1-8b. Self-contained IIFE widget with discovery prompts, localStorage persistence, markdown rendering, deep links to report sections. First real infrastructure (wrangler + Functions). |
| 020 | 2026-02-24 | RUM Traffic Intelligence | Cross-referenced 1,648 RUM bundles (157K views, 152 URLs) with static content analysis. Priority reshuffling: 5 upgraded, 4 downgraded, 4 new. 31 stale pages with traffic vs 41 safe to archive. Homepage TTFB 2,767ms. 22-action revised plan in visual report. First performance-category (red) report. |
| 021 | 2026-02-24 | Brand Evolution Archaeology | Traced 8-year naming history: Project Helix (2018) > Franklin (2022) > Next-Gen Composability (Summit 2023) > Edge Delivery Services (Oct 2023). 6+ names documented, domains verified via cURL, 30+ helix-* repos still active on GitHub, 13 legacy references on aem.live. Critical finding: hlx.live returns 403 not 301 (SEO link equity loss). Visual timeline report. |
| 022 | 2026-02-24 | Brand Analysis Sprint | 10-report brand audit suite built in one session. 8 parallel research agents launched simultaneously. Reports: brand guidelines, opportunities, link equity, competitor positioning, SEO signals, brand consistency (mean 76/100), readability (FK 7.8–13.8), developer touchpoints (33% AEM-branded), brand evolution (6+ names over 8 years), performance validation (Lighthouse 100 substantiated). 14 total reports in hub. |
| 023 | 2026-02-24 | Chat Manus-Style Redesign | User rejected card-based chat design, provided 4 Manus 1.6 screenshots as reference. Full rewrite: document-flow messages, "✨ blazar" labels, suggestion rows, monochrome palette, 420px sidebar. Also improved mind map layout (proportional angular allocation, larger radii) and switched to gpt-oss-120b model. Deployed to production. |
| 024 | 2026-02-24 | RUM Report Bolder Design | Critique → bolder pipeline on RUM Traffic Intelligence report. 10 changes: 42px header, section-specific accent colors (8 unique), 3-tier bar chart heat coding, priority shift as hero section (red tint + border), stat card hierarchy (48px top row), responsive devices grid, entrance animations (fade-up on scroll), shift table auto-classified row borders. All additive CSS — no structural rewrite. |
| 025 | 2026-02-24 | Image Quality Report Simplification | Critique → simplify pipeline. Killed 4-stat hero grid (replaced with bold 3.6/10 lede), promoted AI comparisons to first section, added `<details>` toggles for progressive disclosure, removed misleading "8/10 target" badges, merged inventory+brand into one section, compressed benchmarks to table, compressed validation to footer line. 930 → 775 lines. |
| 027 | 2026-02-24 | Shared CSS Extraction | Extracted shared CSS from 14 reports into `reports/blazar-reports.css` (~220 lines). Tokens, reset, nav, header, cards, tables, badges, quote blocks, bar charts, grade cards, validation stamps. 3 parallel agents processed all files. Design changes now propagate automatically. |
| 028 | 2026-02-24 | Multi-Tab Chat | Chat widget upgraded from single conversation to multi-tab system. Tab bar with close buttons, history dropdown for reopened past chats, localStorage migration from old format. All within the single chat.js IIFE. |
| 029 | 2026-02-24 | Chat UX Polish | 5 UX fixes from critique: touch targets enlarged (24-28px), icon+label header buttons, persistent tab bar when history exists, history item previews with message count, header-tab border integration. All in chat.js. |
| 030 | 2026-02-24 | Read/Write Mode Toggle | Added write mode toggle to chat input — pencil pill button that switches from read-only (answer from reports) to write mode (propose new reports for gaps). Split API system prompt into READ/WRITE variants with shared report context. Phase 1 → Phase 2 inflection point. |
| 031 | 2026-02-24 | Mind Map Website Thumbnail | Replaced blue gradient circle at mind map center with a CSS-only mini browser window showing simplified aem.live homepage (chrome, nav, hero with "Build. Author. Publish.", content blocks). No external image needed. |
| 032 | 2026-02-24 | Chat Write Toggle: Icon Only | Removed "Write" text label from read/write mode toggle button, keeping only the SVG pencil icon. Single-line edit to button HTML in chat.js — aria-label provides accessibility. |
